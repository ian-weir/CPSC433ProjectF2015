How to run the program:
First in the source folder run "make"
Then start the program: java Main (Optional parameters : weightMinFilled weightPref weightPair weightSecDiff penCourseMin penLabMin penNotPaired penSection)
    They must be in that order and you must have all of them if you even want to change 1 from the default value
If your're running deptinst1 or 2 it will take ~10-15 minutes based on the current settings


How we fixed evalPair:
    Essentially we decided that how we had written Pair initally might not be the best (since we had changed aspects of our program since) so it was
    rewritten to it's current form.
